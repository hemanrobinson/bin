# Better Binning

Binning (adjusting ranges or categories) is distinct from zooming (adjusting scales). With independent, interactive controls, both binning and zooming enable users to explore their data.

[This project demonstrates a user interface for interactive binning.](https://hemanrobinson.github.io/bin/)

This project uses [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3) and [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui), and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
